# Sample configuration file for mmlabc-to-smf-rust
# 
# Place this file as "mmlabc-to-smf-rust.toml" in the directory where you run the tool.
#
# Configuration options:

# external_smf_player: Command to use for playing generated MIDI files
# Default: "cat-play-mml"
# 
# Examples:
#   external_smf_player = "timidity"
#   external_smf_player = "fluidsynth"
#   external_smf_player = "vlc"
#
# If not specified, the tool will use "cat-play-mml" as the default player.

external_smf_player = "cat-play-mml"

# use_drum_channel_for_128: Map tracks containing @128 to MIDI channel 9 (drum channel)
# Default: true
#
# When enabled, any track (delimited by ';') that contains a @128 program change
# will be assigned to MIDI channel 9 (0-based), which is the standard General MIDI
# drum channel. This conforms to the mmlabc format specification.
#
# Examples:
#   "@0c;@128d;@1e" -> Channel 0: normal, Channel 1: maps to 9 (drums), Channel 2: normal
#   "@128cde;@1cde" -> Channel 0: maps to 9 (drums), Channel 1: normal
#
# Set to false to disable this behavior and keep channels as assigned sequentially.

use_drum_channel_for_128 = true
